# Mouse bindings

#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings)
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)

  - { mouse: Middle, action: Paste }
  - { mouse: Right, action: Copy }
